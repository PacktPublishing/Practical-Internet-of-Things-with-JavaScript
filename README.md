# Practical Internet of Things with JavaScript
This is the code repository for [Practical Internet of Things with JavaScript](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/advanced-iot-javascript?utm_source=repository&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=repository&utm_term=9781788292948), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
This book will focus on building IoT-based Web projects that will drive you to the next level of your IoT understanding. This book will follow a project based approach that will teach you to build standalone exciting projects and will also teach you to extend your project to another level. We will use Raspberry Pi 3 and JavaScript as the base to build all these projects. We will begin with talking about IoT and start with building a small weather station with temperature, humidity and atmosphere pressure measurement. You will further integrate Alexa with this weather station. You will then build a healthcare project that will show you how the data from the system is analysed and put back into the system to make it better. Lastly, with the help of sensors and actuators you will build a smart office manager and an pet feeder.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
// MongoDB connection options
    mongo: {
        uri: 'mongodb://admin:admin123@ds241055.mlab.com:41055/iotfwjs'
    },

    mqtt: {
        host: process.env.EMQTT_HOST || '127.0.0.1',
        clientId: 'API_Server_Dev',
        port: 8883
    }
};
```
